This code is for a cool portfolio website I built using HTML and CSS. It's got a sleek navbar that changes color when you hover over it, a Projects section to showcase my work, and an About Me section where I spill a bit about myself. Oh, and don't forget the fancy hover effects on the project cards and the cool footer at the bottom!

Feel free to clone this repo, tweak it to your liking, and show off your skills. Happy coding!
